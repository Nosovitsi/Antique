# Backend Updates (July 2025)

This document summarizes the key changes and improvements made to the Python backend.

## 1. CORS and Endpoint Stability

- **Problem:** Initial issues with CORS preflight requests and `400 Bad Request` errors for `POST` endpoints (e.g., `/live_sessions`, `/messages`).
- **Solution:**
    - Ensured `Flask-CORS` is correctly configured globally in `backend/app/__init__.py`.
    - Removed redundant explicit `OPTIONS` route handling from individual blueprints.
    - Corrected route definitions by removing trailing slashes where necessary (e.g., `/live_sessions` and `/messages`) to prevent `308 Permanent Redirect` issues that break CORS preflights.

## 2. Supabase Connection Stability

- **Problem:** Intermittent `httpx.ReadError: [Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable` errors when fetching data from Supabase (e.g., `/auth/profile`, `/messages` GET). This indicated connection pooling or resource management issues under concurrent requests.
- **Solution:**
    - Upgraded `supabase-py` to a version that supports `httpx` client configuration.
    - Configured `httpx.Client` globally in `backend/app/supabase_client.py` with connection pooling limits (`max_connections=100`, `max_keepalive_connections=20`). This improves connection reuse and stability, mitigating the "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors.

## 3. Enhanced Error Logging

- **Improvement:** Added `traceback.print_exc()` to exception handling blocks in `get_profile`, `get_messages`, and `send_message` functions in `backend/app/routes.py`. This provides full traceback information in the server console for easier debugging of unexpected errors.

## 4. Real-time Messaging (Future Work)

- **Current Status:** Real-time message updates are not yet implemented. Messages are currently fetched via `GET` requests, requiring a screen refresh to see new content.
- **Next Steps:** Implementation of WebSockets (e.g., using `Flask-SocketIO`) is required to enable real-time message delivery and display.
