# Plan for Python Backend

This plan outlines the steps to create a Python backend for the Antique Feed application. The backend will replace the current frontend-only requests.

## 1. Scaffolding the Python Backend (Completed)

*   Created a `backend` directory in the root of the project.
*   Inside the `backend` directory, created the following structure:
    *   `app/`: This will contain the main application logic.
        *   `__init__.py`: Initializes the Flask application.
        *   `routes.py`: Defines the API routes.
        *   `models.py`: Defines the data models.
        *   `services.py`: Contains business logic.
    *   `tests/`: This will contain the tests for the backend.
    *   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies.
    *   `.env`: Will store environment variables (e.g., database connection strings).
    *   `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to set up and run the backend.

## 2. Setting up the Python Environment (Completed)

*   Installed `pipenv` for managing Python dependencies.
*   Created a virtual environment for the project.
*   Installed the necessary dependencies:
    *   `Flask`: For the web framework.
    *   `Flask-CORS`: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    *   `python-dotenv`: To manage environment variables.
    *   `supabase-py`: To interact with the Supabase backend.

## 3. Implementing the Backend (Completed)

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Implemented user registration and login endpoints.
    *   (JWTs for securing endpoints will be addressed during frontend integration).
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   Created CRUD endpoints for products.
    *   Created endpoints for managing user sessions.
    *   Created endpoints for handling live chat messages.
*   **Database Integration:**
    *   Connected to the Supabase database using the `supabase-py` library.
    *   (Data access layer in `models.py` will be implemented as needed during further development).

## 4. Integrating the Frontend with the Backend (Completed)

*   Updated the frontend code to make API calls to the new Python backend instead of directly to Supabase.
*   Modified the authentication logic to use the new authentication endpoints.
*   Ensured that the frontend correctly handles the data returned by the backend.
*   **Note:** Real-time functionality (e.g., chat updates, product status changes) currently relies on polling or will require a WebSocket implementation in the backend and corresponding frontend changes.

## 5. Testing

*   Write unit tests for the backend logic.
*   Write integration tests to ensure the frontend and backend are working together correctly.

## 6. Documentation

*   Update the `README.md` with instructions on how to run the entire application (both frontend and backend).
